## 🎨 Styling

We use Tailwind CSS for styling. Custom components are built on top of Radix UI primitives for accessibility and flexibility. Check out `src/components/ui` for our component library.

## 🤝 Contributing

Before adding new components, please check if a similar component already exists in `src/components/ui`. Follow the existing patterns for consistency.

```bash
npm run lint
```
